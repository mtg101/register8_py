    I'm going to borrow the romanization of Hiragana from Japanese to give me Japanese-sounding names.
    And I'm going to bastardize it so I have enough for 128 pairs (max 8bit index 254 for last pair)

    Single chars: like Elite, just ignore space when printing ("A TADA" is "TADA", "BAN KIRU" becomes "BANKIRU")

    Spaces aren't needed because if you want multiple names, you ask for them.
